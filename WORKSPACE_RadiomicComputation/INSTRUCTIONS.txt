******************  INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING THE EXAMPLE WORKSPACE ******************
*************************************************************************************

1. Clone the GitHub repository on your computer by running "git clone https://github.com/mvallieres/radiomics-develop.git" in the terminal. Enter your GitHub username and password.

2. Copy the folder "WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation" (radiomics-develop/WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation) to your favorite working directory on your computer (don't run things from your cloned GitHub directory). The "CSV" folder (and files in it) along with the "script_ReadData.m" and "script_ComputeRadiomics.m" files are mandatory to run the example experiments (thus to be copied), but it is not necessary to copy the "INSTRUCTIONS.txt", "RADIOMIC_OUTPUT.txt" and "WORKSPACE_FORMAT.txt" files.

3. Download the example DICOM dataset at: https://www.dropbox.com/s/525ojtavw6y3liu/DICOM.zip?dl=0

4. Extract the DICOM folder (DICOM.zip downloaded in step 3), and move it inside the WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation folder that you copied in step 2.

5. Adapt lines 48 and 143 of "script_ReadData.m" and "script_ComputeRadiomics.m"s (respectively) to point to the full path of the ../radiomics-develop/Code that you have just cloned from GitHub.

6. Navigate in MATLAB inside the WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation folder that you copied in step 2, and run "script_ReadData.m". At the end of this step, new .mat files for all scans of all patients will be saved in a new folder "DATA" inside the WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation folder that you copied in step 2.

7. Run script_ComputeRadiomics.m in the WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation folder. At the end of this step, new .mat files for all scans defined in all .csv files in "/radiomics-develop/WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation/CSV" will be saved in a new folder "FEATURES/RAW" inside the WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation folder that you copied in step 2. Please see "RAW_RADIOMIC_OUTPUT.txt" in the WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation folder for more details about the format of these files. In the folder "FEATURES", organized CSV files grouping data for all patients will also be created, along with associated TXT files describing the variable names of each CSV data file. Please note that one CSV file is created per scan-imageSpace-roiType.

8. Once step 6 is performed, steps 7 can be repeated using new roiNames_$userDefinedName$.csv files with new ROI names. Please see "WORKSPACE_FORMAT.txt" in the WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation folder for more details. Make sure to also change the "roiType" variable names in the parameter options of script_ComputeRadiomics.m, otherwise the files created in the "FEATURES" folder in step 7 will be overwritten.



--> IMPORTANT: Before performing steps 6 to 8, please make sure to familiarize yourself with: 1) README.md in "/radiomics-develop"; 2) https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07003; 3) WORKSPACE_FORMAT.txt in "/radiomics-develop/WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation"; 4) All comments in script_ReadData.m and script_ComputeRadiomics.m; 5) roiNames_$userDefinedName$.csv files in "/radiomics-develop/WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation/CSV"; 4) INSTRUCTIONS.txt in "/radiomics-develop/WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation"; and 6) RAW_RADIOMIC_OUTPUT.txt in "/radiomics-develop/WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation". Do not hesitate to contact Martin ValliÃ¨res if you have any question.

--> NEW RADIOMICS STUDIES: IF ALL STEPS DESCRIBED ABOVE RUNS FINE ON YOUR COMPUTER USING THE EXAMPLE DATASET AND WORKSPACE, YOU CAN NOW ADAPT THIS WORKSPACE TO COMPUTE RADIOMIC FEATURES ON YOUR OWN DATASETS!!

--> FORMAT OF ROIs: Accepted format are now RTstruct, .nrrd and .img/hdr (3D Slicer). Please see "WORKSPACE_FORMAT.txt" in the WORKSPACE_RadiomicComputation folder for more details.
