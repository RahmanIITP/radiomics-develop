*******  INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING IBSI TEST -- PHASE 1: Feature calculation *********
*************************************************************************************


1. Clone the GitHub repository on your computer by running "git clone https://github.com/mvallieres/radiomics-develop.git" in the terminal. Enter your GitHub username and password.

2. Copy this workspace in a new location on your computer (outside GitHub). Adapt line 40 of "script_IBSI_FeatureCalculation.m" to point to the full path of the ../radiomics-develop/Code that you have just cloned from GitHub.

3. Run "script_IBSI_FeatureCalculation.m" in MATLAB. This script is found in "/radiomics-develop/Tests/IBSI_FeatureCalculation". Make sure the digital phantom "test.m" (also found in "/radiomics-develop/Tests/IBSI_FeatureCalculation") is located in the same folder as "script_IBSI_FeatureCalculation.m" when the script is run. Running this script will result in a new file "IBSIresults_FeatureCalculation.csv" created in the same folder that "script_IBSI_FeatureCalculation.m" is run.


*** It is recommended to run the script outside the GitHub repository on your computer.
*** To conserve up-to-date code on your computer, it is recommended to perform frequent "git pull" of the radiomics-develop GitHub repository in the terminal.
