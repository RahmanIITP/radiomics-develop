********  INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING IBSI TEST -- PHASE 2: Image Processing  **********
*************************************************************************************


1. Clone the GitHub repository on your computer by running "git clone https://github.com/mvallieres/radiomics-develop.git" in the terminal. Enter your GitHub username and password.

2. Download the DICOM data for the IBSI Image Processing tests and unzip the file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NSCW3dAkE1VM0ZtrkvapWHRZR8YyI23E/view?usp=sharing. Dowload the CSV data for the IBSI Image Processing tests and unzip the file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UScFU6R13c6laOrZu6ux1Diq5TFki5XX/view?usp=sharing

3. Create a new workspace outside GitHub*. In this new workspace, insert the two unzipped folders downloaded in step 3 (DICOM_IBSI and CSV_IBSI), as well as the following file: "/radiomics-develop/Tests/IBSI_ImageProcessing/script_IBSI_ImageProcessing.m". Your working directory (i.e. workspace) should now contains 2 folders and 1 .m file.

4. Adapt line 103 of "script_IBSI_ImageProcessing.m" to point to the full path of the ../radiomics-develop/Code that you have just cloned from GitHub.

5. From the workspace created in step 4, run "script_IBSI_ImageProcessing.m" in MATLAB. Running this script will result in new "IBSIresults_ImageProcessing_CaseX.csv" files created in the same folder that "script_IBSI_ImageProcessing.m" is run, where "X" refers to Cases 3, 4 and 5 of the tests defined in the IBSI reference manual.



*** It is recommended to run the script outside the GitHub repository on your computer.
*** To conserve up-to-date code on your computer, it is recommended to perform frequent "git pull" of the radiomics-develop GitHub repository in the terminal.
